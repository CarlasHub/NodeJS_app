I use built this app to train myself on the backend  I just styled the templates very little because my main focus was to learn how to properly connect and  creates the logic to back-end  and the components and features accessed by a user through a front-end.

This is a NODEjs/ express app with CRUD functionality uses a callback functions whose parameters are request and response objects.  Stores and retrieves JSON data using MongoDB, a NOSQL database   hook up in a sandbox database on mLab,  free cloud-hosted "sandbox" database. Data sent through HTTP requests
 
#Steps:

2-	Installed the npm packages.

10-	Set up mongoose schemas  and models Mongoose to provide database access. object schema Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.” asynchronous operation means that a process operates independently of other processes, Mongoose acts as a front end to MongoDB, which is an open source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. A “collection” of “documents”, document storage and query system looks very much like JSON, and is hence familiar to JavaScript developers.Mongoose”

11-	Create a models directory

12-	Use module.exports

For using the Local Authentication Strategy, we need to install the passport-local module: npm install passport-local

24-	Serializing and Deserializing User Instances

25-	Passport also needs to serialize and deserialize user instance from a session store in order to support login sessions, so that every subsequent request will not contain the user credentials. It provides two methods serializeUser and deserializeUser
